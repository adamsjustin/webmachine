/* Lines 23-26: Which number is it?

  *The Modal can display two possible issue numbers in its header*:
  The to-be issue# of an issue being created (assuming "Create Work Item 
  was clicked"), OR the issue# of an existing issue (assuming "Manage/Edit" 
  was clicked from within a Work Item card).

  Moreover, this Modal receives two props whose names can seem confusing
  at first glance: isssueNumber and issue. issueNumber[prop] is a Number.
  issue[prop] is an Object (whenever it is received). HOWEVER, upon initial mounting,
  issue[prop] will be an empty string, which JavaScript evaluates to a falsy value.
  Whenever an admin clicks on the button to edit a work item card (an issue, ultimately),
  a method, and with it a sequence of operations, will be triggered and an object with
  the data of the issue to be edited will be saved into the Highest Order Component's (HOC) state;
  this altering of state (at the highest level) will trigger a "cascading re-render",
  starting at the HOC and propagating to all of its children (this Modal being one of them).
  At this point (whenever this happens), Modal will receive the issue[prop] not as an empty
  string, but as an object, which JavaScript will evaluate as a truthy value.

  Lines 23-26 attempt to determine which issue# to display in the Modal's header;
  "is it a new work item, or is it an existing one being edited?"

/* Lines 29-29: Nested Ternary

  We use a nested ternary expression here to enforce conditional rendering.
  The Modals "mode" ("create" or "manage", kept track of by the triggeredBy
  property in the HOC's state), determines which form to render within the
  modal's body. Upon initial mounting, triggeredBy is an empty string. Upon
  initial mounting, even though the modal itself is not visible until triggered,
  its code gets rendered in the DOM, and along it, the code for any form which 
  the ternary expression outputs. Ideally, we don't want the code for a form to
  be sitting in the DOM until it's needed (that is, until the modal is triggered).
  So, we use a nested ternary to render a form (by first checking in which mode
  the modal has been triggered) ONLY if triggeredBy[prop] is not empty. If
  triggeredBy[prop] is not empty, that means one of the two button that trigger the
  modal has been clicked. Then, and only then, do we bring in our respective form.
